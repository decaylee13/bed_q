Hospital Bed Allocation: A Sequential Deep Q-Learning Approach
**Problem Definition and Context**
This document formalizes a reinforcement learning approach to optimize hospital bed allocation using a sequential decision-making framework compatible with Deep Q-Networks. The objective is to develop an intelligent system that assigns patients to appropriate hospital beds to maximize care quality while minimizing wait times and resource mismatches.

**Environment and Data Structures**
1. Patients vector
2. Beds vector 
3. Hospital vector

**Markov Decision Process (MDP)**
1. State Space
2. Action Space


Reward Function 


**Deep Q-Network Implementation**
